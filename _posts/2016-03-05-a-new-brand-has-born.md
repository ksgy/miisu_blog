title: A new brand has born

## About miisu.co.uk

On a sunny Saturday, we decided to step up and try something new. To have a brand which focuses on simplicity and elegance. Nothing less, nothing more. So we had the idea, we just had to make it happen. That was the tricky part.

First of all research. What e-commerce we're going to use? Checked a lot. From the simplest one, like having the pages in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), doing the payment via [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) to the most robust one.

Then we just realised we don't even know what features we'd like to use in the future. So, we wrote a quite detailed list what we need and what we would need in the future. All got together, so we made a decision. [Magento](https://magento.com/), community edition. I regret that moment, many times. As many times as I thank myself :)

After choosing the right host, we started to play around. Slowly, but got together. It was a bit of a fun to learn this robust monster. It's completely the opposite of what I like in a platform, but we couldn't found any good alternative what we would need in the future.

## The design and the implementation

In the meantime, we started to look around for a designer. We knew [Marina](http://marinakiss.com/) for a long time, so it was obvious to ask her if she's interested in branding/design of MiiSU. She accepted the challenge and after a couple of weeks, we had our design ready for the site.

Next step was to implement the design and make as simple as it can be for the launch.

Sadly, I couldn't help myself to do some UX stuff on it; like if you are on the [index page](http://miisu.co.uk) you see that little arrow on the bottom bouncing, letting your subconscious know, you have to scroll down :)

Let us know if that worked on Twitter [@miisujewel](http://twitter.com/miisujewel)

...and Choose you! Either you're a developer or not :)

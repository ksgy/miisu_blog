## Last 7 months

...was really busy for us and for the brand as well. Lots of planning, preparing, executing and of course, learning :)

Learning online marketing, social marketing, how social networks are working and how you can use them efficiently. Learning how to take proper product photos with a mobile which look professional is really a hard work. Lots of trial and error... and more :)

That's why we took a step ahead and started learning DSLR photography. It's even harder and more complex than just taking pictures with a mobile phone, but spending hours and hours sitting in front of the computer retouching a single product photo is not something you want to do if you're a jewelry designer.

Your brain dreams about that new necklace popped into your mind, but still, it's 3am in the morning and you're not even nearly satisfied with the end result of the photo you're working on.

We're only at the beginning, but we already see how professional photos can change the first impression of a product. How the customer can see what we really creating. It's just inevitable, where you need to show the quality and every small detail about your product, your life.

## So,
We'd like to show what our products and our life is about: we're opening the business within 2 weeks!

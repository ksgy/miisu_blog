Not long ago, we've created a Pinterest board called [Fashion Sketch](https://uk.pinterest.com/MiiSUjewel/fashion-sketch/). After a couple of days, we were amazed by the many hits and pins on that board. At that moment we realised, we've not highlighted enough one of the most important parts of MiiSU: where does it fit fashion? How can you wear it and why we call it elegant and filigree? What does "Clear lines in Design" mean? Why is it "Special & Captivating"? What do we mean by Coziness & Quality?

To answer that, you have to see the jewellery in context. In an environment where it belongs, where it lives. Where it makes the best out of it.

We love art and fashion, mixed with simplicity and elegance, showing the gist of each jewellery.

The idea is now to start a series of showcase about our pieces, wore by our magnificent models - but who will breathe a soul into an imaginary model of MiiSU?

We knew [Reka](mailto:imreka.design__at__gmail.com) for a couple of years for now, and thanks to a lucky coincidence, our lives crossed paths again. Reka is learning graphics design at university and also working as a freelance designer.

When we told her about our idea, having an "imaginary model" using India ink and digital work as well, she was into the job immediately.

So, let us introduce you to MiiSU's first model, Jolie, wearing our very first piece, the [RED HEART FILIGREE NECKLACE](http://miisu.co.uk/red-heart-filigree).

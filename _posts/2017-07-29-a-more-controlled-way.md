So I was playing with our Nikon D3300 for a while now. Done lot of types of photography. Not saying I'm mastered in each of them, just tried to play around.

After a long thinking and evaluation period, I came to a conclusion which part of photography interests me. So far, I tried to recreate "famous" pictures and also get inspiration and make my own on these topics.

## Street photography
Tried that many times, as it's popular and so diverse. However, I just simply can't do much. I can't really find any inspiration. At least, not in "classic" street photography.

## Architecture
Never been an architecture fan. You can judge me, but I even hated going to church and museums when I was a kid, although it was mandatory when we were visiting different cities on holiday. I saw a lot, I can see the beauty of it, but it just doesn't move me.

## Landscape
I love landscapes. I love big mountains, rivers, huge fields, the breeze, the black night skies. But not on a photo :) I love to be there, but it's like making a movie from a book: 99% of the time is way-way less. And you can't really give it back, how it *feels* to be there. The way I see is you're taking senses away. The wind, temperature, the sun or the rain. The cold spiky feeling on your face when walking in fog on a cold wintery day. For me, sadly, it's way much less. And I hate the feeling that I can share only a small part of beautiful thing around me.

## Portrait photography
The more I like this type I photography, the more I realise how much I don't know about and how much practice would I need to do it on that level that I like.
I've done a few sessions now and now I can see how much I don't know about portraits. It seems so easy when you see a well-composed, well-lighted photo. But you can't see the work and the experience the photographer has behind the scenes. How much work was to perfect those skills to that level where you can confidently create impressing portraits. Lots of trial and error.
Sometimes — like 1 out of 1000 shots — I make a really good one which I'm 99% satisfied with. But putting that together in a more mindful and controlled way — the lighting, the pose, the colours, the style, daytime, etc. — that is a challenge and needs a lot of practice.

## Food
Food is everywhere. You can't avoid that :) Since I'm cooking for ourselves — which is like 10+ years now — I'm confidently re-creating any dish by just tasting and even created lots of own dishes. The kitchen is my second home and I really like to show the food itself. It's a bit like landscape photography: you show something leaving out at least two other senses: taste and smell. It's hard, but unlike in landscape, you can "cheat" here with your senses. As <a href="http://www.andrewscrivani.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Scrivani</a> described it in his video: when you see a picture of a cone ice-cream which just started to melt and one small drip is just about to drop off of the edge of the cone...
Everyone has been there. Everyone can relate to that moment, everyone tried to save that small bit of melted ice-cream by quickly licking it :)

<a href="http://www.andrewscrivani.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Scrivani</a>'s work was/is a huge inspiration for me, finding *that* moment for a dish or any kind of food is as satisfying as being there.

## Product
Since I started photography, this is the second most interesting topic I've been doing. The first one obviously is food photography, but it's just because I relate food more than 1o years now. I know how to cook them, how to present, how to make you feel you want it or make you feel jealous eating it ;)
Product photography, from my perspective, is very close to food photography. You want to show something to the world and make the audience not just *like* it, but *want* it!
In MiiSU's case, create that need to wear that piece. To make you think how- and where you can wear it.
It's hard. You don't smell the jewelry, you don't taste the jewelry. You touch it, feel it, the weight, the texture, how warm or cold is the feel. How it works with your current clothes and style. So many variables to consider.
If you wear a jewelry, you're picky — in a good way. You want to show your best with that piece. You want to wear something that gives you confidence. Which makes you feel you're beautiful or fairly conservative. You want to be you.

That's really hard, but I'm on track. Still, there is a lot to learn to achieve a photo as described above, but now that I know what I want to show, now I can work on the _how_ part :)
To understand the psychology behind these feelings. To be the person, who chooses the jewelry carefully and wants to be self-confident all the way.

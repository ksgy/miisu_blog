In the past two months, I've been shooting all around London, trying out new styles, stretching boundaries.

Invested into a NIKON 50mm 1.8G aspherical lens - which is more like a 70mm on a crop sensor camera. The difference compared to the kit lens of the D3300 is just unbelievable. More colourful, more sharp, more BOKEH! :) Simply love it.

I still can't say I found my own style, but it's getting more and more clear what I like in a photo and why I like it. As a developer, I always liked simple, yet useful, functional things in life. It's not really different in my visual world: I like photos with simple lines and lots of negative space... The way you can play with it really can change the mood and the message.

When I started learning photography and shooting product photos for MiiSU, I felt this is something you can pick up quickly. Which is half-true. You can learn the technical aspects really fast, you just have to experiment, watch how others do and learn to use your equipment. But after a while, I felt like I have to step back and experiment on different topics and subjects. To see where are the boundaries of my gear and from where it's the creativity. Learn the basics, see what makes a photo good or bad, what colours, techniques, approach people like. Also, why do they like it? This led me to learn some psychology as well, how the brain works, how the eye works and what happens in the brain when someone likes a photo. I really like to do this kind of background researches. It gives me much more control what and how I'd like to show on a photo, or what story I'd like to tell. Like the manual mode of a camera: I enjoy using the semi-auto functions (A, S), but when I have the time to prepare for a shoot, I prefer using the manual mode. It takes a bit more time to take a photo, but that photo will look like immediately as I'd like it to look.

Sometimes I wonder above a picture, with thousands of likes on 500px - why is this picture is so popular, why people like it. Because I don't. At all. This is where subjectivity comes in picture. I like interesting pictures, or ones with a story, which you can stare for minutes because it makes you think. Probably that's the reason I like minimalist photos. Where the audience has to figure out what's the subject, or the story, or even the product.

Once a friend told me: take everything away until you can't take anything away anymore. That's when you get the real thing... and I couldn't agree more.


### Here are some of my latest shots with the new 50mm lens

Yesterday, the last part has finally arrived for our little studio.

When I started shooting product photos with DSLR, I quickly realised that I need light. A lot. Not just sunshine through a window - which is quite rare in the UK anyway - but a controlled light, which we can rely on, any day, any time.

I started to experiment with some low-cost DIY solutions to make sure our photos are bringing the same quality and mood, regardless of weather. But sadly, I've failed, many times on many levels.

First of all, at the time, I did not realised what we really needed. I wanted to create a nice light box, where we can have a well-diffused light coming from two directions, making sure there are no sharp shadows around the product. But, I was wrong.

After a couple of setups, I found out how and why those images worked we took in the past.

We had the following:

- The Sunshine, shining through a thin layer of cloud, so it was diffused a bit
- A big window, where not just enough light could get in, but coming through a large surface, so we could control how the light shines on the product
- A bit of a backlight - using reflectors

I approached the problem from the wrong end. I tried to mimic the environment, instead of trying to achieve what we really needed: a great, controlled shine on our products. How can we achieve this?

We needed to create our own artificial window! The bigger and brighter, the better.

We bought two 500W halogen Tungsten lights and put around our new setup. One behind the lightbox to get some backlight if needed, and one on the side, so we can control how and where the product shines.

The first test shots are very promising compared what we could accomplish using only natural light, usually in a very narrow time-frame.
